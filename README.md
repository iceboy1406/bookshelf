BookShelf is an App to manage books that separate books to 2 Shelf (Finished Read Shelf and Unfinished Read Shelf). I create this website for Dicoding Submission in Learn to Make Frontend-Web for Beginner class. 

## Technology Used
- HTML
- SCSS

Because this is use ES Module so this can't be simply run by open html file directly. You must use a local server (ex: live-server extension on VSCode or package live-server from npm),

For easiest way you can follow instruction below.
